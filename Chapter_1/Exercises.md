## **Exercise 1: What is the function of the secondary memory in a computer?**

**Correct answer:**  
`d) Take input from the user long term, even beyond a power cycle`

**Explanation:**  
Secondary memory (like HDDs, SSDs, USB drives) is used for long-term data storage, unlike main memory (RAM), which is volatile.

---

## **Exercise 2: What is a program?**

A **program** is a set of instructions that a computer follows to perform a specific task or solve a problem.

---

## **Exercise 3: What is the difference between a compiler and an interpreter?**

- A **compiler** translates the whole program into machine code **before** execution.
- An **interpreter** translates and executes the program **line by line** at runtime.

---

## **Exercise 4: Which of the following contains "machine code"?**

**Correct answer:**  
`a) The Python interpreter`

**Explanation:**  
It’s written in machine code to run on your computer. It takes Python code and translates it to machine code during execution.

## **Exercise 5: What is wrong with the following code?**

```python
>>> print 'Hello world'
>>> print('Hello world")
## 🛠️ Issues in the Code

**Original Code:**

```python
>>> print 'Hello world'
>>> print('Hello world")

Issues:

    Line 1: Missing parentheses (Python 3 syntax requires print()).

    Line 2: Mismatched quotes (" and ').

✅ Corrected version:

print("Hello world")

✅ Exercise 6: Where in the computer is a variable such as x = 5 stored after the program runs?

Correct answer:
b) Main Memory

Explanation:
Variables like x = 5 are stored in RAM (main memory) during execution.
✅ Exercise 7: What will the following program print out?

x = 43
x = x + 1
print(x)

Answer:
b) 44

Explanation:
x starts at 43, then is incremented by 1, so the output is 44.
✅ Exercise 8: Match each computer component with a human capability
Computer Component	Human Equivalent
Central Processing Unit	Brain – does the thinking and decision making
Main Memory	Short-term memory – quick temporary storage
Secondary Memory	Long-term memory – permanent storage
Input Device	Senses – eyes, ears (e.g., keyboard, mouse)
Output Device	Mouth or hands – communicates or acts
